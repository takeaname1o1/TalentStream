-   `assessment-builder.tsx`: A comprehensive client component that provides a form for creating new assessments. It uses `react-hook-form` for state management and `zod` for validation. It allows users to add a title, description, and dynamically add, remove, and configure different types of questions (e.g., multiple choice, text input). It also renders a live preview of each question as it's being configured.
